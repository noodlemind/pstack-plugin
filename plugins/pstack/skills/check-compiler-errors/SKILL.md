## OpenAI runtime contract

Read [the adapter contract](../../references/runtime-contract.md) before this workflow. It maps provider selection, agent calls, loops, persistent state, history, verification, and authorization. That contract supersedes Cursor-specific execution syntax and unverified model fallbacks below; the engineering steps remain required. Use native tools in the current host by default. Cloud uses its available OpenAI models. No remote laptop connection, server URL or MCP setup is permitted. Optional local CLI adapters require explicit environment-local selection. Do not claim cross-provider diversity for OpenAI-only review.


# Check compiler errors

## Trigger

Compile or type-check failures are blocking local validation or CI.

## Workflow

1. Run the repo's compile and type-check commands.
2. Summarize errors by file and type.
3. Fix the highest-confidence issues first.
4. Re-run checks until clean or blocked.

## Output

- Current compile and type-check status
- Error summary grouped by file and category
- Fixes applied and remaining blockers
