## OpenAI runtime contract

Read [the adapter contract](../../references/runtime-contract.md) before this workflow. It maps provider selection, agent calls, loops, persistent state, history, verification, and authorization. That contract supersedes Cursor-specific execution syntax and unverified model fallbacks below; the engineering steps remain required. Use native tools in the current host by default. Cloud uses its available OpenAI models. No remote laptop connection, server URL or MCP setup is permitted. Optional local CLI adapters require explicit environment-local selection. Do not claim cross-provider diversity for OpenAI-only review.


# Review and ship

## Trigger

Reviewing changes before shipping. Close key issues, verify behavior, and open or update a PR.

## Workflow

1. Gather context: diff against base branch, uncommitted changes, recent commits, changed files, and user intent from recent relevant chats if useful.
2. Run targeted tests for changed behavior. If no focused tests exist, decide whether to add them or document the gap.
3. Review for correctness, regressions, security, and intent fit. Use parallel subagents for larger diffs.
4. Fix critical issues before finalizing and re-run affected tests.
5. Commit selective files with a concise message.
6. Push branch and open or update a PR.

## Suggested Checks

```bash
git fetch origin main
git diff origin/main...HEAD
git status
gh pr checks --json name,bucket,state,workflow,link
```

## Guardrails

- Prioritize correctness, security, and regressions over style-only comments.
- Keep commits focused and avoid unrelated file changes.
- If pre-commit checks fail, fix the issues rather than bypassing hooks.
- Use `gh pr checks` instead of GitHub Actions-only commands when judging PR readiness.

## Output

- Findings summary (critical, warning, note)
- Tests run and outcomes
- PR URL
