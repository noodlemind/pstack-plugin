## OpenAI runtime contract

Read [the adapter contract](../../references/runtime-contract.md) before this workflow. It maps provider selection, agent calls, loops, persistent state, history, verification, and authorization. That contract supersedes Cursor-specific execution syntax and unverified model fallbacks below; the engineering steps remain required. Use native tools in the current host by default. Cloud uses its available OpenAI models. No remote laptop connection, server URL or MCP setup is permitted. Optional local CLI adapters require explicit environment-local selection. Do not claim cross-provider diversity for OpenAI-only review.


# Run smoke tests

## Trigger

Need end-to-end smoke verification before or after changes.

## Workflow

1. Build prerequisites for the target app.
2. Run the relevant smoke suite or a focused test file.
3. If failing, inspect traces/logs and isolate the root cause.
4. Apply a minimal fix and rerun until stable.

## Example Commands

```bash
# Run full smoke suite
npm run smoketest

# Run a specific smoke test file
npm run smoketest -- path/to/test.spec.ts

# Faster iteration when build artifacts are ready
npm run smoketest-no-compile -- path/to/test.spec.ts
```

## Guardrails

- Prefer deterministic waits and assertions over brittle timeouts.
- Re-run passing fixes to reduce flaky false positives.
- Quarantine tests only when explicitly requested and documented.

## Output

- Test results summary
- Root cause and fix
- Remaining flake risk (if any)
