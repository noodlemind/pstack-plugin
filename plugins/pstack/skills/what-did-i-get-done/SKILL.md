## OpenAI runtime contract

Read [the adapter contract](../../references/runtime-contract.md) before this workflow. It maps provider selection, agent calls, loops, persistent state, history, verification, and authorization. That contract supersedes Cursor-specific execution syntax and unverified model fallbacks below; the engineering steps remain required. Use native tools in the current host by default. Cloud uses its available OpenAI models. No remote laptop connection, server URL or MCP setup is permitted. Optional local CLI adapters require explicit environment-local selection. Do not claim cross-provider diversity for OpenAI-only review.


# What did I get done

## Trigger

Need a short, high-signal summary of work completed in a specific time range (for example: yesterday, last 3 days, or last week).

## Workflow

1. Resolve the requested time window into concrete dates.
2. Read commits authored by the current git user email within that range.
3. Exclude merge commits and uncommitted changes.
4. Synthesize the most important shipped changes into a concise status update.
5. Include the actual date range used in the final summary.

## Guardrails

- Be extremely concise and information-dense.
- Prioritize substantial behavior or architecture changes.
- Omit cosmetic-only changes (formatting, imports, minor renames).
- Do not infer intent or motivation. Describe changes functionally.

## Output

- One short summary suitable for a status update
- Real date range
- Optional 2-5 bullets for major changes only
